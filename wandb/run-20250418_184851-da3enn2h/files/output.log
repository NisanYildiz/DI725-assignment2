The secret `HF_TOKEN` does not exist in your Colab secrets.
To authenticate with the Hugging Face Hub, create a token in your settings tab (https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens), set it as secret in your Google Colab and restart your session.
You will be able to reuse this secret in all of your notebooks.
Please note that authentication is recommended but still optional to access public models or datasets.

Loading YOLOS model from hustvl/yolos-small
Some weights of YolosForObjectDetection were not initialized from the model checkpoint at hustvl/yolos-small and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:
- class_labels_classifier.layers.2.bias: found shape torch.Size([92]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([9]) in the model instantiated
- class_labels_classifier.layers.2.weight: found shape torch.Size([92, 384]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([9, 384]) in the model instantiated
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Our suggested max number of worker in current system is 2, which is smaller than what this DataLoader is going to create. Please be aware that excessive worker creation might get DataLoader running slow or even freeze, lower the worker number to avoid potential slowness/freeze if necessary.
