Loading YOLOS model from hustvl/yolos-small
Some weights of YolosForObjectDetection were not initialized from the model checkpoint at hustvl/yolos-small and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:
- class_labels_classifier.layers.2.bias: found shape torch.Size([92]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([9]) in the model instantiated
- class_labels_classifier.layers.2.weight: found shape torch.Size([92, 384]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([9, 384]) in the model instantiated
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
